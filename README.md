# mpss-modules 3.6 (October 2nd, 2015)

Does not compile with `4.2.5-ARCH`. Compiles on openSUSE 13.2 with `4.1.12` default flavor. Seems to be working correctly; further testing is due.

Should compile and work under `3.14.4` too (based on work from [@xdsopl](https://github.com/xdsopl/mpss-modules))
